# Submitting Plugins

OpenGamepadUI maintains a plugin store where users can download and install
community created plugins. This list of plugins is maintained in the
[OpenGamepadUI-plugins](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI-plugins)
repository.

To have your plugin considered for inclusion in the plugin store, ccreate a
pull request to the plugins repository with an entry for your plugin.

> :warning: Please be aware that we do not allow private repositories, "black-box"
> binaries, deliberately obfuscated code or any other items that would undermine
> the ability to verify the functionality of a plugin and or any underlying
> software.
